      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the year comes to an end, consider what you can do in your community. Join school boards. Run for local and state offices. Write to your legislators. Talk to people. Educate them, and listen to them. There are deep divides between people in this country, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a lot of work to bridge them and build a better consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this country become abetter placedespite the current circumstances, we need to talk to each other, talk to our legislators,and participate in government. We will only getthrough this together withmutual education and the execution of civic duties. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy, and there are obstacles, but it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hallowe&#39;en Update</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s the week following Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en. Since I last posted, I turned 21, had my parents visit, completed that presentation I was worried about, and participated in a Lovecraftian bike race. In addition, the house that I live in hosted a very nice Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en dance, and I finished some homework. So some good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, on the horizon I see lots of work in my future. A midterm in my Akkadian letters seminar&amp;ndash;I have to translate PBS &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 58, an unedited text from the Middle Babylonian period&amp;ndash;and then I also have a presentation next week in the same archaeology course as last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me not dwell on the negatives that are swiftly approaching. This past weekend, the weekend of Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en, I did several things, but one thing that was quite fun was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/tourdetentacle/&#34;&gt;Tour de Tentacle&lt;/a&gt;, a Lovecraftian bike-ride-cum-scavenger-hunt put on by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weirdprovidence.org/&#34;&gt;Lovecraft Arts and Sciences Council&lt;/a&gt; here in Providence. It was a blast. We started out at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arcadeprovidence.com&#34;&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, the nation&amp;rsquo;s oldest indoor shopping mall, where LASC has their homebase and emporium, and then headed out into the city. We went on a whistle-stop tour of the libraries and locales of Downcity and the East Side, in particular the John Hay Library at Brown, the Annmary Brown Memorial, the Providence Athenaeum, Prospect Park, and Wayland Square. All told, I think I went up and down College Hill at least three times that day. In the end, we stopped some dastardly cultists from resurrecting H.P. Lovecraft, and retired to the Arcade for fortifying libations at New Harvest, just as it was beginning to rain. I had a great time, and all of the volunteers did a great job making it a fun activity. I hope to be able to help out if they do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fun thing that happened that weekend was a fantastic pick-up game of Call of Cthulhu that one of my friends ran while he was visiting for the weekend. I played Father Gilles Savatier, Catholic Priest, formerly of the Séminaire de Québec, and as a group the party consisted of members of the Providence Botanic Society. We went to rural West Virginia to search for one of our fellow members who was missing, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give anything away, let me just say that the game ended with Father Savatier devoured by horrible gribbly monsters and with a fellow party member killing a lovely old lady in cold blood. It was a tad darker than some of the other games I&amp;rsquo;ve played in and run, and my friend did a great job of making it clear that our actions had consequence while at the same time removing avenues of possibility. However, it never felt railroady, which I commend him for. I do think that I may end up writing up the scenario in a more publishable and fleshed-out form, as I feel that the storyline could lend itself to good convention play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening, I played some Android: Netrunner with a friend. I&amp;rsquo;d never played before, and usually I don&amp;rsquo;t really like card games that much, but I found it very enjoyable and really had some fun, even though I lost three out of three games. I partially blame my tired brain after minimal sleep, but I also didnt learn as quickly as I needed to. Next time, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Thanksgiving approaches, and with it, hard deadlines. I have to finish my thesis proposal and get some work done in the lab. In addition, I have to start thinking about the three or four final projects that I will have to do this semester. Oy. In any case, I will have to do all of that after I finish the things I have to do immediately. C&amp;rsquo;est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forts, Forts</title>
      <link>https://meptrsn.github.io/blog/post/forts-forts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now doing some research for a presentation next week on Egyptian forts in Nubia. It turns out that this is quite the topic, and the professor I&amp;rsquo;m taking the seminar with is quite interested in it. Specifically, she is heavily involved with excavations at Uronarti, a fortress in southern Lower Nubia. This is somewhat intimidating, and I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what I should do to ensure I do a good job. When I told her my choice of topic, she said: &amp;ldquo;going for the professor&amp;rsquo;s research area, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty ballsy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that bodes well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on the relations between fortresses and their hinterlands, specifically in terms of how cultural exchange occurred between the fortresses (presumably belonging to occupiers) and their surroundings (presumably belonging to the occupied). I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on wrapping my head around the topic as a whole, because my background is more heavily in Assyriology, not in Archaeology. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great grounding in Nubian studies, and so taking this &lt;em&gt;graduate&lt;/em&gt; seminar has been a bit of a learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well. At least there&amp;rsquo;s wine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit hard-going with my research work for my thesis. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45909007_Granular_Flows_in_Split-Bottom_Geometries&#34;&gt;split-bottom flow cell&lt;/a&gt; for granular flow research; unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s been rather difficult to install the glass beads on the sides of the walls with epoxy. Due to the curved surface, it&amp;rsquo;s sort of tricky to coat the walls evenly. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get the cell walls (a polycarbonate cylinder) to seat properly due to splotches of epoxy that thicken the walls in some places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on getting the cell fully assembled, and then installing the lighting and camera for image capture. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using digital image correlation (DIC) to extract velocity fields from the image data, and getting some good data from my lab setup will be a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just recently set up this blog, mainly as a sort of matter of course, but hopefully it will eventually act as a way to record thoughts and ideas, as well as a place to document projects.&lt;/p&gt;
