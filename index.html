<div>
  
    Well, it&rsquo;s the week following Hallowe&rsquo;en. Since I last posted, I turned 21, had my parents visit, completed that presentation I was worried about, and participated in a Lovecraftian bike race. In addition, the house that I live in hosted a very nice Hallowe&rsquo;en dance, and I finished some homework. So some good things.
Unfortunately, on the horizon I see lots of work in my future. A midterm in my Akkadian letters seminar&ndash;I have to translate PBS 1&frasl;2 58, an unedited text from the Middle Babylonian period&ndash;and then I also have a presentation next week in the same archaeology course as last time.

<div>
  
    I&rsquo;m now doing some research for a presentation next week on Egyptian forts in Nubia. It turns out that this is quite the topic, and the professor I&rsquo;m taking the seminar with is quite interested in it. Specifically, she is heavily involved with excavations at Uronarti, a fortress in southern Lower Nubia. This is somewhat intimidating, and I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I should do to ensure I do a good job.

    It&rsquo;s been a bit hard-going with my research work for my thesis. I&rsquo;ve been working on building a split-bottom flow cell for granular flow research; unfortunately, it&rsquo;s been rather difficult to install the glass beads on the sides of the walls with epoxy. Due to the curved surface, it&rsquo;s sort of tricky to coat the walls evenly. In addition, it&rsquo;s difficult to get the cell walls (a polycarbonate cylinder) to seat properly due to splotches of epoxy that thicken the walls in some places.

    <p>I have just recently set up this blog, mainly as a sort of matter of course, but hopefully it will eventually act as a way to record thoughts and ideas, as well as a place to document projects.</p>
