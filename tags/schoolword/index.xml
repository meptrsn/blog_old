      <title>Forts, Forts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now doing some research for a presentation next week on Egyptian forts in Nubia. It turns out that this is quite the topic, and the professor I&amp;rsquo;m taking the seminar with is quite heavily involved with it. Specifically, she is heavily involved with excavations at Uronarti, a fortress in southern Lower Nubia. When I told her my choice of topic, she said &amp;ldquo;Going for the professor&amp;rsquo;s research area, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty ballsy.&amp;rdquo; So that bodes well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on the relations between fortresses and their hinterlands, specifically in terms of how cultural exchange occurred between the fortresses (presumably belonging to occupiers) and their surroundings (presumably belonging to the occupied). I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on wrapping my head around the topic as a whole, because my background is more heavily in Assyriology, not in Archaeology. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great grounding in Nubian studies, and so taking this &lt;em&gt;graduate&lt;/em&gt; seminar has been a bit of a learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well. At least there&amp;rsquo;s wine.&lt;/p&gt;
